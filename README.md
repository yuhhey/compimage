Detailed description

This library helps with the workflow of handling images created using more than one photo taken. I call them composite image as the final output is composed of several images.

It can be used to identify image sequences that belong to one composite image. Besides identifying this library can automatically generate certain type.

The following image sequences are supported
- HDR
- Panorama
